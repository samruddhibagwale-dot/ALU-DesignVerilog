# ALU Design using Verilog

This project is created for Task-1 of the CODTECH Internship.

## Objective
To design a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) supporting
ADD, SUB, AND, OR, and NOT operations.

## Files
- alu.v : ALU design
- alu_tb.v : Testbench
- simulation_report.txt : Simulation details

## Result
The ALU works correctly for all operations.
